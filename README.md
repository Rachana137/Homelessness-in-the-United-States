# Homelessness-in-the-United-States

## Introduction
  Homelessness in America varies greatly by state.  Housing and Urban Development has gathered point-in-time estimates of homelessness for several years.  The problem is to gather other features at the state level, such as economics, weather, policy data and see if homelessness can be predicted.This repository contains publicly available data/information which helps to determine how to engineer features that can be useful in a model.  The model should predict both levels of homelessness and changes in homelessness over time.
  
## Data Sources

 The key findings of the Point-In-Time (PIT) count and Housing Inventory Count (HIC) conducted in January 2019. Specifically, this report provides 2019 national, state, and CoC-level PIT and HIC estimates of homelessness, as well as estimates of chronically homeless persons, homeless veterans, and homeless children and youth.
